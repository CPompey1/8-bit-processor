# 8-Bit Processor on FPGA

# Project Description
This repository contains the Verilog implementation of an 8-bit processor designed for CSE490 - Computer Architecture. The processor features a single-cycle, non-pipelined architecture and is composed of modular components including an ALU, register file, instruction memory, data memory, sign extender, control unit, multiplexer, and program counter. Each module is independently testable with its own testbench, and the design is intended for simulation and educational purposes. The project demonstrates fundamental computer architecture concepts and digital design practices.

## data_memory
Contains `data_memory.sv`, `data_memory_testbench.sv`, and `instruction_mem.txt`

*note: if you are going to use these files in EDA playground, you must use the simulator called 'GPL Cver 2.12.a'*

## instruction_memory
Contains `instruction_memory.sv`, `data_memory_testbench.sv`, and `data_memory.txt`

*note: if you are going to use these files in EDA playground, you must use the simulator called 'GPL Cver 2.12.a'*
